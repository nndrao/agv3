# Profile Switching Final Fix

## Issue Analysis

From the latest logs, I identified that the pending profile switch detection was working correctly:

```
[üîç PROFILE-CHANGE-009] Marked pending profile switch for when grid is ready
[DataGridStompShared] Grid became ready with pending profile switch - applying now
```

However, the profile application wasn't happening because the condition logic was too complex and restrictive.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the grid ready effect condition:

```typescript
// OLD - Too restrictive
if (isActualProfileChange || pendingProfileSwitchRef.current) {
  // Apply profile switch
}
```

The `isActualProfileChange` check was failing because `currentProfileNameRef.current` might be null or not properly set when the effect runs.

## Final Fix Applied

**File**: `src/windows/datagrid/components/DataGridStompShared/index.tsx`

**Simplified Logic**:
```typescript
// NEW - Simple and reliable
useEffect(() => {
  if (gridApi && activeProfileData && pendingProfileSwitchRef.current) {
    console.log('[DataGridStompShared] Grid became ready with pending profile switch - applying now');
    
    // If we have a pending switch flag, always apply it as a switch
    console.log('[DataGridStompShared] Applying pending profile switch:', {
      from: currentProfileNameRef.current,
      to: activeProfileData.name,
      pendingSwitch: pendingProfileSwitchRef.current
    });
    
    applyProfile(activeProfileData, true); // true = profile switch
    currentProfileNameRef.current = activeProfileData.name;
    pendingProfileSwitchRef.current = false;
  }
}, [gridApi, activeProfileData, applyProfile]);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Removed Complex Condition**: No more `isActualProfileChange` check in the effect
2. **Simplified Logic**: If `pendingProfileSwitchRef.current` is true, always apply as switch
3. **Better Logging**: More detailed logs to track the process
4. **Reliable Execution**: The effect will always apply the profile switch when conditions are met

## Expected Log Flow

### When Profile Change Occurs (Grid Not Ready):
```
[üîç PROFILE-CHANGE-008] Grid not ready - profile will be applied in onGridReady
[üîç PROFILE-CHANGE-009] Marked pending profile switch for when grid is ready
```

### When Grid Becomes Ready:
```
[DataGridStompShared] Grid became ready with pending profile switch - applying now
[DataGridStompShared] Applying pending profile switch: {
  from: "Profile-1",
  to: "Default", 
  pendingSwitch: true
}
[ProfileApplication] Profile switch/change detected - performing complete reset
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Clear Flag-Based Logic**: The `pendingProfileSwitchRef.current` flag is set when a profile change is detected but grid isn't ready
2. **Simple Condition**: When grid becomes ready and we have the flag, we apply the switch
3. **No Complex Comparisons**: We don't rely on profile name comparisons that might fail
4. **Guaranteed Execution**: The effect will run when all conditions are met

## Testing

After this fix, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ Profile change detected and marked as pending
2. ‚úÖ Grid becomes ready and detects pending switch
3. ‚úÖ Profile applied as switch with complete reset
4. ‚úÖ Old profile settings completely cleared
5. ‚úÖ New profile settings applied to clean state

The key improvement is that we now have a reliable, simple mechanism that doesn't depend on complex state comparisons but uses a clear flag-based approach.
