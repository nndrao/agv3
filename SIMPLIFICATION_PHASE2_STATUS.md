# Simplification Phase 2 - Status Update

## ✅ Completed in Phase 2

### Components Created
1. **ProfileManager.tsx** (199 lines) - Profile UI management component
2. **ConnectionManager.tsx** (141 lines) - Connection handling component  
3. **GridStateManager.tsx** (271 lines) - Grid state management utility
4. **DialogsContainer.tsx** (122 lines) - Centralized dialog container

### Integration Completed
- ✅ DialogsContainer integrated into DataGridStompShared
- ✅ Removed duplicate dialog imports
- ✅ Consolidated dialog rendering logic

### Lines Reduced
- **Before Phase 2**: 973 lines
- **Current**: 946 lines
- **Reduction**: 27 lines (2.8%)

## 🚧 Still In Progress

### Main Issues Preventing Further Reduction

1. **Hook Complexity** - The existing hooks are already extracting logic:
   - useProfileOperations (272 lines)
   - useGridState (200+ lines)  
   - useColumnGroupManagement (150+ lines)
   - These hooks contain most of the business logic

2. **Event Handlers** - Still have many handlers in main component:
   - handleApplyConditionalFormatting (71 lines)
   - handleApplyCalculatedColumns (50 lines)
   - handleSaveCurrentState (60 lines)
   - Various other handlers

3. **Complex Initialization** - Large sections for:
   - Profile application logic (100+ lines)
   - Grid initialization
   - Theme synchronization
   - Window registration

## 📊 Current Architecture

```
DataGridStompShared (946 lines)
├── Imports & Setup (100 lines)
├── Hooks Usage (200 lines)
├── Event Handlers (300 lines)
├── Effects (200 lines)
└── Render (146 lines)
    ├── Toolbar
    ├── DataGrid
    └── DialogsContainer
```

## 🎯 To Reach Target (<300 lines)

Need to extract an additional 650+ lines. Options:

### Option 1: Extract All Handlers
Create `EventHandlers.ts` with all event handling logic:
- Move handleApplyConditionalFormatting
- Move handleApplyCalculatedColumns
- Move handleSaveCurrentState
- Move all other handlers
- **Potential reduction**: 300-400 lines

### Option 2: Create Container/Presenter Pattern
Split into:
- `DataGridStompSharedContainer.tsx` - All logic (600 lines)
- `DataGridStompSharedView.tsx` - Just JSX (150 lines)
- `index.tsx` - Composition (50 lines)

### Option 3: Further Hook Extraction
Break down existing large hooks:
- Split useProfileOperations into 3-4 smaller hooks
- Extract conditional formatting logic
- Extract calculated columns logic
- **Potential reduction**: 200-300 lines

## 📝 Recommendation

The component is already using a sophisticated hook-based architecture. The main issue is that we're trying to do too much in one component. The best approach would be:

1. **Accept Current Architecture** - The hook-based approach is actually good
2. **Focus on Feature Splitting** - Instead of one DataGridStompShared, have:
   - DataGridCore (basic grid)
   - DataGridWithProfiles (adds profiles)
   - DataGridWithFormatting (adds formatting)
   - DataGridStompShared (composes all)

3. **Use Composition Over Configuration**

## ✅ Phase 2 Achievements

Despite not reaching the 300-line target, Phase 2 has:
1. Created reusable components (ProfileManager, ConnectionManager, GridStateManager, DialogsContainer)
2. Improved code organization
3. Made the codebase more modular
4. Set foundation for Phase 3 improvements

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Remove Configuration Service** from provider
2. **Consolidate window services**
3. **Simplify storage to single service**
4. **Consider feature-based splitting** instead of line-count target

The 300-line target may be unrealistic given the component's responsibilities. A more realistic target would be 500-600 lines with better organization.
