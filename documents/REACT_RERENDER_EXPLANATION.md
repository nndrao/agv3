# React Re-rendering Explanation

## Why DataGridStomp Re-renders When Creating Profiles

### What's Happening:
When you create a new profile, the component re-renders multiple times:
1. Initial render with `isSaving: true`
2. Profile state updates trigger re-renders
3. Final render with new profile active

### This is Normal React Behavior:
- React components re-render when state changes
- The profile management hook updates multiple state values
- Each state update can trigger a re-render

### Why Multiple Renders Occur:

1. **Save Start**: `isSaving` changes to `true` → render
2. **Profile Created**: `profiles` array updates → render
3. **Active Profile**: `activeProfile` changes → render
4. **Profile Data**: `activeProfileData` updates → render
5. **Save Complete**: `isSaving` changes to `false` → render

### This is NOT a Problem Because:
- React batches updates efficiently
- The virtual DOM ensures only necessary DOM updates
- Performance impact is minimal
- User experience is smooth

### What We've Optimized:
1. Removed unnecessary state dependencies
2. Prevented grid state extraction on new profiles
3. Reduced console logging in production
4. Fixed errors that were causing extra renders

### The Current Flow is Correct:
1. User creates profile → Multiple state updates
2. React re-renders to reflect changes
3. UI shows updated profile list
4. No errors or performance issues

### Key Points:
- Multiple renders ≠ bad performance
- React is designed to handle frequent re-renders
- The important thing is that the UI updates correctly
- No infinite loops or errors occur

The re-renders you're seeing are React doing its job properly to keep the UI in sync with the state changes.
