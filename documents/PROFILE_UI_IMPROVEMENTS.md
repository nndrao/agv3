# Profile Management UI Improvements

## Recent Changes (2025-07-21)

### Simplified and Logical UI Layout

The profile management UI has been reorganized for better usability:

#### Before:
- Profile selector on the left
- Save buttons far away on the right side
- Both "+" and "Save As..." buttons (redundant)

#### After:
```
[Profile Dropdown] [+] [⚙] [Save*]
```

- Profile selector with integrated controls
- "+" button creates new profile (replaces "Save As...")
- "⚙" button opens profile management dialog
- Save button changes color when there are unsaved changes

### Key Improvements:

1. **Logical Grouping**: Save button is now next to the profile selector since it operates on the current profile

2. **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated "Save As..." button since "+" already handles creating new profiles

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Save button shows amber background when there are unsaved changes
   - Asterisk (*) indicates unsaved changes
   - "Saving..." text during save operation

4. **Cleaner Toolbar**: Profile management is now a cohesive unit, separate from other controls

### User Flow:

1. **Select Profile**: Use dropdown to switch between profiles
2. **Save Changes**: Click Save when button shows amber/asterisk
3. **Create New**: Click "+" to create a new profile with current settings
4. **Manage All**: Click "⚙" for full profile management (rename, delete, import/export)

### Implementation Details:

The save button intelligently:
- Disables when no profile is active
- Shows loading state during save
- Highlights with amber when changes need saving
- Provides clear tooltips

This design follows the principle of keeping related actions together and eliminating redundant controls.
