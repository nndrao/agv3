# Profile Management Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-21

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. ✅ TypeError: getSortModel is not a function
**Root Cause**: AG-Grid API methods were called without checking if they exist.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added validation before calling methods
if (validateGridApi(gridApiRef.current)) {
  columnState = gridApiRef.current.getColumnState();
  filterModel = gridApiRef.current.getFilterModel();
  // Safe check for getSortModel
  if (typeof gridApiRef.current.getSortModel === 'function') {
    sortModel = gridApiRef.current.getSortModel();
  }
}
```

#### 2. ✅ Profile Count Not Updating After Save
**Root Cause**: State updates were not properly synchronized after saving.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced logging in useProfileManagement to track profile updates
- Made SaveProfileDialog properly async to wait for save completion
- Added isSaving state to prevent double-saves
- Improved state update flow after save

#### 3. ✅ Grid State Not Fully Restored
**Root Cause**: Only column state was being applied, not filter and sort state.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Now applying all grid state on profile load
if (profile.columnState) {
  gridApiRef.current.applyColumnState({ state: profile.columnState, applyOrder: true });
}
if (profile.filterModel) {
  gridApiRef.current.setFilterModel(profile.filterModel);
}
if (profile.sortModel) {
  gridApiRef.current.setSortModel(profile.sortModel);
}
```

#### 4. ✅ Added Grid API Validation
**Enhancement**: Added proper validation before using grid API.

```typescript
function validateGridApi(gridApi: GridApi | null): boolean {
  if (!gridApi) return false;
  const requiredMethods = ['getColumnState', 'getFilterModel', 'applyColumnState', 'setFilterModel'];
  return requiredMethods.every(method => typeof (gridApi as any)[method] === 'function');
}
```

### Technical Improvements:

1. **Safe State Extraction**: Grid state is now extracted with proper error handling
2. **Complete State Restoration**: All grid state (columns, filters, sorts) is now properly saved and restored
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around grid API calls
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Added debug logging to track profile operations
5. **Async Dialog Handling**: SaveProfileDialog now properly waits for save to complete

### User Experience Improvements:

1. **No More Errors**: Fixed the getSortModel error that was breaking profile saves
2. **Profile List Updates**: New profiles now appear immediately in the dropdown
3. **Complete State Save**: Grid filters and sorts are now preserved in profiles
4. **Visual Feedback**: "Saving..." indicator in dialog during save operation

### Testing Checklist:

- [x] Create new profile without errors
- [x] New profile appears in dropdown immediately
- [x] Selected datasource provider persists in profile
- [x] Grid column state is saved and restored
- [x] Grid filter state is saved and restored
- [x] Grid sort state is saved and restored
- [x] Save button shows unsaved changes indicator
- [x] No console errors during profile operations

### Debug Information:

The system now logs:
- Profile save operations with before/after counts
- Grid API validation results
- State extraction operations
- Profile list updates

This helps diagnose any remaining issues with the profile system.
