# Session Context - January 14, 2025

## Session Overview

This document captures the context from our extended conversation on January 14, 2025, regarding the OpenFin implementation for AGV (Advanced Grid Visualization) project.

### Main Topics Discussed:
1. Issues with current AGV1 OpenFin implementation
2. Decision to start fresh with AGV3 project
3. Architecture design for OpenFin-first approach
4. Unified configuration schema
5. Phase 1 implementation plan for STOMP datasource system

### Key Decisions Made:
- Start fresh implementation in AGV3 to avoid mixed paradigms
- Use OpenFin channels for all cross-window communication (no React hooks for data)
- Implement headless providers in hidden windows
- Use unified configuration schema for all component types
- Support both local and MongoDB storage

### Files Created/Updated:
- `/mnt/c/Users/developer/Documents/projects/agv3/documents/OPENFIN_DOCK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `/mnt/c/Users/developer/Documents/projects/agv3/documents/OPENFIN_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (with Phase 1 details)
- This context file

## Background Context

### Previous Work on AGV1
The user had been working on integrating OpenFin into the existing AGV1 React application. Key work included:
- Debugging dock buttons and STOMP data source provider
- Fixing test connection with WebSocket errors
- Implementing field inference
- Creating StompConfigurationInline component

### Issues Identified with Current Implementation:
1. **Mixed Paradigms**: React Context patterns mixed with OpenFin patterns
2. **Incomplete Migration**: Headless provider infrastructure exists but isn't used
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Deep coupling between components
4. **Storage Confusion**: Multiple storage approaches without clear separation
5. **Architecture Mismatch**: Not designed for OpenFin's multi-window paradigm

The STOMP datasource provider was running in the browser context instead of in headless windows as the infrastructure suggested it should.

### Decision to Start Fresh:
After analyzing the codebase, I gave my candid opinion that starting fresh would be better. The user agreed and created a new React project (AGV3) with:
- shadcn/ui
- Tailwind CSS
- AG-Grid support

## Architecture Decisions

### OpenFin-First Approach:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     OpenFin Workspace Platform                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Provider Window │    Dock Component    │   Storage API         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    OpenFin Channel API                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Headless Providers │ DataTable Windows │ Config Dialogs        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Architectural Principles:
1. **No React hooks for data flow** - Use OpenFin channels exclusively
2. **Headless providers** - Run in hidden windows, publish to channels
3. **Standalone windows** - Each window is independent, subscribes to channels
4. **Centralized configuration** - Unified schema, shared via storage service

### Communication Pattern:
```
[External Data] → [Headless Provider] → [Channel] → [DataTable Windows]
```

## Unified Configuration Schema

The user mentioned they had come up with a common schema for storing all component configs:

```typescript
interface UnifiedConfig {
  // Identity
  configId: string;
  appId: string;
  userId: string;
  
  // Component Classification
  componentType: string;      // 'datasource' | 'grid' | 'profile' | 'workspace' | 'theme'
  componentSubType?: string;   // 'stomp' | 'rest' | etc.
  
  // Configuration
  config: any;                // Component-specific configuration
  settings: ConfigVersion[];   // Version history
  activeSetting: string;      // Active version ID
  
  // Audit
  createdBy: string;
  lastUpdatedBy: string;
  creationTime: Date;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  
  // Additional metadata
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  isShared?: boolean;
}
```

### Storage Strategy:
- **Primary**: MongoDB for enterprise deployments
- **Fallback**: Browser localStorage for local development
- Both implement same StorageAdapter interface

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: STOMP Datasource System

The user wants to implement:
1. Basic OpenFin dock with datasource configuration button
2. STOMP datasource configuration dialog (exact copy of current features)
3. Headless STOMP provider running in hidden window
4. DataTable component that:
   - Selects provider from dropdown
   - Fetches snapshot data
   - Receives real-time updates via channels
   - Shows cell flashing on updates
5. Config storage service

### Features to Preserve from Current STOMP Implementation:
1. **Connection Management**
   - HTTP endpoint discovery for WebSocket URLs
   - Connection/disconnection handling
   - Heartbeat configuration
   - Reconnection logic

2. **Field Inference**
   - Analyze JSON message structure
   - Detect field types
   - Build hierarchical field tree
   - 60-second timeout

3. **Column Definition Generation**
   - Convert inferred fields to AG-Grid columns
   - Type mapping
   - Width calculations
   - Filter configurations

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Snapshot collection with batching
   - Incremental updates
   - Duplicate detection using key column
   - Cell flashing on changes

5. **Statistics Tracking**
   - Connection status
   - Message rates
   - Data volumes

## Current State

### Project Setup:
- AGV3 project created at `C:\Users\developer\Documents\projects\agv3`
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- shadcn/ui components installed
- Tailwind CSS configured
- AG-Grid ready

### Documentation:
- Comprehensive implementation blueprint created
- Phase 1 details fully documented
- Code examples provided for all components

### Ready to Implement:
1. OpenFin manifest configuration
2. Provider window with platform initialization
3. Dock with three buttons
4. Storage service with local adapter
5. STOMP configuration dialog
6. Headless STOMP provider
7. DataTable with channel subscription

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. Create OpenFin manifest file
2. Implement provider window entry point
3. Set up dock with buttons
4. Create storage service infrastructure
5. Port STOMP configuration UI
6. Implement headless provider
7. Build DataTable with channel integration

### Implementation Order:
```
1. OpenFin Setup
   ├── manifest.json
   ├── provider.html
   └── provider/main.ts

2. Core Services
   ├── Storage Service
   ├── Channel Service
   └── Window Manager

3. UI Components
   ├── Dock Provider
   ├── STOMP Config Dialog
   └── DataTable Window

4. Data Flow
   ├── Headless Provider
   ├── Channel Publisher
   └── Channel Subscriber
```

## Important Notes

### From User:
- "From now on anything we discuss update the above documents"
- Wants exact feature parity with current STOMP implementation
- Emphasized OpenFin-first architecture (no datasource hooks)
- Config storage needed for Phase 1

### Technical Considerations:
- Use TypeScript throughout
- Follow OpenFin best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add reconnection logic
- Monitor provider health

## Session Summary

We started by analyzing issues with the current AGV1 OpenFin implementation, decided to start fresh with a clean architecture, designed the system around OpenFin's strengths, and created comprehensive documentation for Phase 1 implementation.

The AGV3 project is now ready for implementation with clear architecture, detailed plans, and all necessary documentation in place.

### Last Activity:
Created this context file to preserve session state for future reference.

### Continue From:
Begin implementing the OpenFin manifest and provider window as documented in the Phase 1 Implementation section of OPENFIN_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION.md.
